# About
Image retrieval is a computer vision task of querying a database of images with an image and returning K most similar images from the database, according to some metric. K can be an arbitrary number of images.

The goal of this thesis is to explore the possiblities, the benefits, as well as potential downsides to using the transformer architecture to solve the problem of image retrieval.
